# ZA Developers Slack - Code of Conduct

## TL;DR

* Be respectful of others
* Do not harass others
* Do not share personal information of others to people outside the community
* Job opportunities can be posted in [#work-opportunities](https://zadevelopers.slack.com/messages/work-opportunities/), professional recruitment is not allowed
* Don't spam the channels with links, or links to pages, for the purpose of monetization of user views and which provide no value to the ZA Developer community

This is a safe space, lets keep it that way.

## Code of Conduct

“ZA Developers” in this document refers to the ZA Developers Slack organization at [https://zadevelopers.slack.com/](https://zadevelopers.slack.com/). “The administrators” refers to the administrators on this organization, a [list is available at the top of the Team Directory](https://zadevelopers.slack.com/team) (must be a member of the organization to view).

ZA Developers is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all ZA Developers spaces, including public channels, private channels and direct messages, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the administrators.

Some ZA Developers spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

Harassment includes:

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
* Deliberate misgendering or use of “dead” or rejected names
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate
* Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop.
* Threats of violence
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
* Deliberate intimidation
* Stalking or following
* Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes
* Sustained disruption of discussion
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
* Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse
* Publication of non-harassing private communication

## Conduct specific to recruitment activities

The ZA Developers community, and its admins, acknowledge that finding skilled developers in South Africa is a serious problem that needs attention. However, the ZA Developers community is first and foremost a safe space for developers to talk, share and collaborate. To help ensure this, we will enforce the following conditions regarding recruitment and the publication of recruitment opportunities.

* Professional recruiters will, regrettably, not be granted access to the ZA Developers group under any circumstances.
* ZA Developers members may not, under any circumstances, share the personal details of other ZA Developers members with recruiters without that user's explicit affirmative consent.
* Briefly advertising an opportunity is acceptable on the condition that it is posted only once, and only within the [#work-opportunities](https://zadevelopers.slack.com/messages/work-opportunities/) channel. If a member requests additional information about the opportunity, as the advertiser you are required to continue the discussion through direct messages.
* Opportunities must not, under any circumstances, use referral program links. Such links are defined as any URL which, when visited and whether directly or indirectly, results in benefits being bestowed upon the member responsible for posting the link, e.g. via earning a commission.

We value being able to attract talent to our teams, and a brief message should allow it. New teams in particular are encouraged to post a "We're hiring" message.

## Reporting

If you are being harassed by a member of ZA Developers, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please [contact an admin](https://zadevelopers.slack.com/team) directly via DM. Administrators will respond as soon as they are able. If the person who is harassing you is on the admin team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident.

This code of conduct applies to ZA Developers spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of ZA Developers outside of our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by ZA Developers members, especially the administrators, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from ZA Developers based on their past behavior, including behavior outside ZA Developers spaces and behavior towards people who are not members of the ZA Developers community.

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of ZA Developers members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

## Acceptable Content
The ZA Developers community is a collection of professional developers, as such it is expected that the content made available by members of the community should at all times adhere to the acceptable content policy. This policy is intended to protect the community's image, as well as the image of its members, through restrictions on certain classes of content which may be deemed to be unsuitable in a work or family context.

Classes of content which we deem to be unsuitable include:

 - Pornographic or sexually suggestive material, either in graphic or text form.
 - Depictions of physical or emotional abuse, either in graphic or text form.
 - Persecution of any individual as a result of their race, gender, religion or other physical traits.
 - Material intended to, without basis, harm the reputation of any individual whether a member or not.
 - Unsolicited advertising with the exception of job offers in the [#work-opportunities](https://zadevelopers.slack.com/messages/work-opportunities/) channel.
 - Links, or links to pages, for the purpose of monetization of user views and which provide no value to the ZA Developer community.

As a quick self-check, ask yourself whether you would like someone's child to see the content you are posting. If the answer is "no", then there's a good chance you shouldn't be posting it on the ZA Developers community.

## Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all ZA Developers spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other ZA Developers members and/or the general public.

## Changes
This code of conduct is subject to change as circumstances require, all current members of the ZA Developers community will be notified through the [#code-of-conduct](https://zadevelopers.slack.com/messages/code-of-conduct/) channel prior to these changes taking effect.
